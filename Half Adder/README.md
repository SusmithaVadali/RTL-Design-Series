##  Half Adder – Theory and Truth Table

A **Half Adder** is a combinational circuit that performs the addition of **two binary bits**:  
- **Inputs**: `A`, `B`  
- **Outputs**:  
  - **Sum (S)** – the result of A + B  
  - **Carry (Cout)** – the carry generated by the addition

---

###  Logic Expressions

- **Sum (S)** = A ⊕ B  
- **Carry (Cout)** = A · B

---

###  Truth Table

| A | B | Sum | Cout |
|---|---|-----|------|
| 0 | 0 |  0  |  0   |
| 0 | 1 |  1  |  0   |
| 1 | 0 |  1  |  0   |
| 1 | 1 |  0  |  1   |
